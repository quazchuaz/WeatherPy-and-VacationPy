## WeatherPy
Use data extracted from the OpenWeatherMap API to visualise weather trends based on latitude. The relevant scatterplots are illustrated below:

Based on linear regression models of these trends the one with the highest r-squared value / variance explained by Latitiude is Maximum Temperature.

## VacationPy
Create a map of cities extracted from the relevant dataframe and implement a filter based on temperature, wind speed and cloudiness to view cities with the required weather conditions. Finally, create a message box which appears when hovering over the datapoint on the map which has pertinent information about that city. An example is illustrated below:
